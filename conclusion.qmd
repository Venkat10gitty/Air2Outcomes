# Conclusion

Overall, our exploration suggests that while PM2.5 levels have dropped across all five NYC boroughs since 2010, the benefits have not translated into equally large improvements in asthma/COPD mortality, which especially in the Bronx, which consistently sits near the top of the statewide distribution for deaths even when its pollution is no longer an extreme outlier. By putting NYC in the context of all New York State counties, we saw that the boroughs are “middle of the pack” for PM2.5 but often above-average for mortality, hinting that factors like population density, income, housing, or access to care likely matter as much as small remaining differences in ambient PM2.5. At the same time, our statewide regression and partial-residual view suggest that, even after adjusting for median income and population density, higher PM2.5 is still modestly associated with higher mortality which is more as one contributor among many than a single dominant driver. Methodologically, this project taught us how fragile “clean” datasets can be: aligning three separate systems (EPA AQS, CDC WONDER, ACS) at the county–year level required a lot of FIPS wrangling, manual WONDER exports, and decisions like restricting our main analysis window to 2010–2019 and using 2019 as the only map year with fully complete data. These choices are limitations: we work at county (borough) resolution rather than neighborhoods, we rely mostly on crude rates, and we do not control for age structure, smoking prevalence, housing conditions, or within-borough heterogeneity, so we avoid making any causal claims. A natural next step would be to move to age-adjusted rates and finer spatial units (ZIP codes or census tracts), add other pollutants and weather variables, and link in more detailed socioeconomic and healthcare access measures to see which combinations best explain the persistent excess mortality in places like the Bronx. Finally, on the workflow side, we learned the value of building a reproducible panel early, checking completeness before graphing, and being willing to drop “fancy” ideas that were not feasible under the time and data constraints the lessons that will shape how we scope and document data projects going forward.
